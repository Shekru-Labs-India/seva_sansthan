                      It is our first and foremost objective to inspire people
                      to chant the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra. Chanting the holy
                      name is the Yuga-dharma; and Supreme Lord Sri Krishna
                      descended as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to inaugurate this
                      dharma and propagate the Sankirtana Movement. He desired
                      that the entire world be inundated with the chanting of
                      the holy name. Srila Prabhupada the founder-acharya of
                      ISKCON accepted this as the mission of his life and
                      established the world-wide Hare Krishna Movement to spread
                      the holy names. Following in his footsteps, we, the
                      disciples of Srila Prabhupada, have initiated various
                      programs like Chanters Club, Harinam Festival, Hare
                      Krishna Flash Mobs, etc., to spread the holy names and
                      inspire as many people as possible to chant the Hare
                      Krishna Maha-mantra.

                      The second objective is to maintain opulent and gorgeous
                      Deity worship along with festivals on a grand scale
                      throughout the year. The Supreme Lord Krishna has appeared
                      before us in the form of a Deity to accept our services.
                      Srila Prabhupada established Deity worship as an important
                      part of the Krishna Consciousness movement. He had set-up
                      temples around the world so that his disciples can serve
                      the Deities every day. He also emphasized on decorating
                      the Deities and celebrating festivals in an exuberant
                      manner throughout the year. The Supreme Personality of
                      Godhead Krishna is present in the Deity form. By serving
                      Him, we can purify ourselves from material contamination.
                      By engaging all our senses in directly serving Him, we can
                      get rid of our non-devotional tendencies. It also brings
                      steadiness to our materially agitated mind.

                      saintly personality, his character, his mission and his
                      institution. Srila Prabhupada is the spiritual ambassador
                      who visited this mortal world to show us the path back to
                      Godhead. As his disciples, it is our duty to create
                      awareness about him. He is a bona fide spiritual master in
                      the disciplic succession originating from Brahma. A bona
                      fide spiritual master is not an ordinary man. Just as an
                      ambassador is an authorized representative of his country,
                      similarly, a spiritual master, who comes in the disciplic
                      succession, parampara, is an empowered representative of
                      God. Ordered by his spiritual master, he embarked on his
                      life’s mission to spread the message of Krishna to the
                      English-speaking community. He built a house in which the
                      whole world could live. Read his biography to know more

                      Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam through his books. He
                      founded the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in 1972. He wrote
                      more than 70 books which have been translated into 57
                      languages. To understand any philosophy, reading books
                      form an important tool of comprehension for a reader.
                      Srila Prabhupada encouraged his devotees to circulate
                      books among different communities. Reading books form the
                      basis of understanding the Hare Krishna movement. You can
                      access the catalog of his books. Some of these books are
                      also available for download. We also encourage devotees to
                      read and distribute these books. Srila Prabhupada said
                      that this service of book distribution makes him happy.

                      Touchstone Foundation, an independent trust associated
                      with ISKCON Bangalore, has been involved in various
                      ventures to generate the funds required for sustaining our
                      charitable initiatives. As you exit the temple hall, there
                      are various counters selling prasadam (food offered to the
                      Lord) and devotional artifacts. There is an exclusive
                      section for handicrafts called Dakshinakriti. The food
                      court offers varieties of delicious sattvik preparations
                      to satisfy your taste buds and for a heavy meal you can
                      stop at the Annakuta Restaurant or the Higher Taste
                      Restaurant – God’s own Cuisine. The profits generated from
                      these initiatives support our charitable programs.

                      The next objective is to present, preserve and promote the
                      cultural heritage of India through new projects and
                      capitalize on such opportunities to further the mission of
                      Srila Prabhupada. Krishna Lila Theme Park is one such
                      project which is magnificent in scale. This project is
                      likely to be completed in the year 2021-2022. It is an
                      initiative to present the culture and heritage of our
                      country, as described in the Vedic Scriptures, to the
                      contemporary society in a compelling manner using a
                      narrative strategy – technology assisted multi-sensory
                      immersive and experimental story telling. Disney World and
                      Universal Studios use this kind of communication strategy.
                      We want to use this technology to impress the younger
                      generation with the glories of our heroes like Krishna,
                      Rama, Hanuman, etc. The cost estimate of this project is
                      Rs.350 crores. This Theme Park will be a landmark
                      destination in cultural and religious tourism in
                      Bengaluru.

                      Another objective is to bring about a way of life that is
                      in harmony with nature and offers a sustainable
                      alternative to the dominant consumerist and materialistic
                      world. Srila Prabhupada always instructed his disciples to
                      accept a simple life style. He always stressed on simple
                      living and high thinking. He initiated the farm project at
                      New Vrindavan, United States. ISKCON Bangalore has its
                      farm in Mahadevapura where there are hundreds of cows and
                      bulls. There is also a goshala in the temple premises at
                      Hare Krishna Hill which maintains around 25 cows.

                      Food distribution is considered to be the supreme of all
                      charities. Srila Prabhupada wanted everyone to taste the
                      nectar of devotion. The food that is offered to Krishna is
                      considered the divine nectar that can alleviate our
                      suffering by freeing us from sins. Srila Prabhupada
                      insisted that everyone who visits the temple must get some
                      prasadam. We have been distributing kichadi prasadam to
                      every visitor since the inception of the temple and in the
                      year 2015 we have also started the Nitya Annadana program
                      which provides sumptuous lunch prasadam to visitors every
                      day from 11:30 am to 2:00 pm.
