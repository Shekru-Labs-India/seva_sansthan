                      <strong>What is the mission of human life?</strong>
                      &nbsp;The mission of human life is to end the miseries of
                      material existence and attain a blissful life. We are
                      constantly searching after happiness, but we often fail in
                      our pursuit. We may get a glimpse of happiness, but it
                      does not last forever. We do not want miseries, but we
                      cannot avoid them. Scriptures inform us that we are
                      spiritual beings, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord Sri
                      Krishna, and by nature we are full of happiness –&nbsp;
                      <strong>ānandamayo ‘bhyāsāt</strong>&nbsp;(vedānta-sūtra).
                      Then, why do we suffer?&nbsp;How do we rediscover the lost
                      happiness and lead a blissful life?

                    <p className="post-desc">
                      Srila Prabhupada, our beloved spiritual master and the
                      founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna
                      Consciousness (ISKCON) has blessed us with this
                      opportunity for a happy and peaceful life. We just have to
                      practice the following principles:
                    </p>
                    <ol className="post-desc">
                      <li>
                        Chant the holy names, Hare Krishna maha-mantra every day
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Read the Srimad Bhagavatam, the spotless purana that
                        glorifies the Supreme Lord
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Honor prasadam, the food sanctified by offering to the
                        Supreme Lord
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p className="post-desc">
                      Just by following the above three principles one can
                      achieve real happiness in life. How does this work?
                    </p>
                    <p className="post-desc">
                      First, let us understand the root cause of our problems
                      that makes our life miserable. We are entrapped in this
                      material world from time immemorial and the happiness we
                      pursue here is temporary and illusory. In the pursuit of
                      such happiness, we engage in various activities, pious and
                      sinful, that binds us more and more in this material
                      world.
                    </p>
                    <p className="post-desc">
                      Our miseries are due to the sinful reactions and when we
                      follow these three principles, all the material
                      contaminations and sins are washed away; consequently, we
                      are reestablished in our real constitutional position of
                      unlimited bliss and happiness.
                    </p>
                    <p className="post-desc">
                      Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said: ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam
                      bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ: Chanting the holy names of
                      the Lord cleanses the mirror of the heart and stops the
                      miseries of the blazing fire of material existence.
                    </p>
                    <p className="post-desc">
                      Srimad Bhagavatam says: naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ
                      bhāgavata-sevayā: All the inauspicious things in our heart
                      are completely destroyed by reading Srimad Bhagavatam
                      every day. The darkness of ignorance is dissipated and we
                      become situated in the mode of goodness and develop all
                      good qualities equivalent to that of the demigods.
                    </p>
                    <p className="post-desc">
                      By honoring prasadam (food offered to the Lord) we do not
                      incur further sinful reactions. Krishna says in the
                      Bhagavad-gita (3.13): yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante
                      sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ: devotees who eat food offered first in
                      sacrifice (as an offering to the Lord) are released from
                      all kinds of sins.
                    </p>
                    <p className="post-desc">
                      Thus, by following these three simple, but effective
                      principles given by Srila Prabhupada, we can achieve a
                      life of happiness, good health, peace of mind, and all
                      good qualities.
